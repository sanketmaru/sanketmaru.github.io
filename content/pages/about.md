I am a developer, who likes exploring different technologies and deep dive into it to gain more insights. 
I am starting this blog to bring practical use cases to the web and share a bit of learnings with the world.

Below are some of the PR's i have made to the open source projects and hacked to fix the issues. 

1. [angular-metawidget](https://github.com/metawidget/metawidget/pull/50)
2. [react-theming/storybook-addon-material-ui](https://github.com/react-theming/storybook-addon-material-ui/pull/48)
3. [ecommerce](https://github.com/sanketmaru/ecommerce)

Apart from technology, coding i like spending time with my 3yo daughter and capture every photo of her. :-)
